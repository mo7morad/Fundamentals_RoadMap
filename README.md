### **🔢 Problem-Solving Level 04 (C++)**
- 📁 **Projects**
  - **🏛️ #ProjectContinuation:BankExtension2.cpp**
    - Continuing the project and building more features like user login and a management system with restricted access rights and transfer menus.
  - **🏛️ #ATM-System-Project.cpp**  

    - 💳 **ATM System Simulation** – A console-based C++ program that replicates ATM functionalities.  
  
    ## ⚡ **Features**  
    
    🔹 **Quick Withdraw**  
    - 💰 Predefined professional withdrawal amounts.  
    - ✅ Ensures **sufficient balance** before completing the transaction.  
    
    🔹 **Normal Withdraw**  
    - 💵 Users can withdraw a **custom amount** (must be a multiple of **5**).  
    - ✅ Ensures **sufficient balance** before proceeding.  
    
    🔹 **Deposit**  
    - 🏦 Allows users to **deposit a specified amount**.  
    - 📈 Updates the **balance** after a successful deposit.  
    
    🔹 **Check Balance**  
    - 📊 Displays the **user's current account balance**.  
    
    🔹 **Logout**  
    - 🔄 Returns to the **login screen**, requiring users to re-enter credentials to access the ATM system.  
    
    ## 🔍 **How It Works**  
    
    🔐 **User Authentication**  
    - 🔢 Users enter their **account number and PIN**.  
    - 🗂️ Credentials are **validated** against a file (**clients.txt**).  
    - ✅ If authentication is **successful**, the main menu is displayed.  
    
    💸 **Transaction Processing**  
    - 📂 The system **reads and updates** account balances from a file (**clients.txt**).  
    - 📥 **Deposit and withdrawal** operations modify the balance and save the updated data back to the file.  
    - ❌ Withdrawals **prevent overdrawing** if insufficient funds.  
    
    📑 **File Handling**  
    - 📜 User data (**Account Number, PIN, Name, Phone, and Balance**) is stored in **clients.txt**.  
    - 🔄 The system dynamically **loads and saves client data**.

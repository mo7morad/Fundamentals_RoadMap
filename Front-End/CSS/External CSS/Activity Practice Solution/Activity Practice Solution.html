    This is a sample paragraph demonstrating external CSS styling. The CSS rules in the separate file "styles.css" ensure that
    the design is consistent and easy to maintain across multiple pages.

  <!-- Documentation:
       Using an external CSS file improves code reusability and design consistency because all styling rules are centralized in one file.
       This allows you to easily update the design across multiple pages by editing just one CSS file. It also keeps your HTML cleaner 
       by separating content from presentation.

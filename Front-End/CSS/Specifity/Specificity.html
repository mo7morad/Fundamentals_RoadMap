  <title>CSS Specificity Example</title>
  <style>
    /* Element Selector: Lowest specificity */
    p {
      color: blue;
    }
    /* Class Selector: Medium specificity */
    .important {
      color: green;
    }
    /* ID Selector: Higher specificity */
    #special {
      color: orange;

<body>
 
    <!-- This paragraph has n element selector, an ID, a class, and an inline style -->
  <p id="special" class="important" style="color: red;">
    This text will be red because inline styles win the contest!
  </p>

  <!-- This paragraph has an element selector, an ID, a class -->
  <p id="special" class="important" >
    This text will be orange because ID slector win the contest!
  </p>

  <!-- This paragraph has element selector and  a class selector -->
  <p  class="important" >
    This text will be green because class slector win the contest!
  </p>

  <!-- This paragraph has only element selectore -->
  <p>
    This text will be blue because element slector has lowest specificity and no other specificity compete with it.

<!-- What is Specificity?
- Definition: Specificity is a system used by browsers to decide which CSS rule should be applied if multiple rules target the same element.

-How It Works: CSS rules are ranked by specificity in the following order (from highest to lowest):

1- Inline styles (e.g., <p style="color: red;">)
2- IDs (e.g., #header)
3- Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes (e.g., .highlight, [type="text"], :hover)
4- Elements and pseudo-elements (e.g., p, h1, ::first-line)

- Imagine specificity as a contest 🏆 where the rule with the highest specificity takes home the styling prize! -->

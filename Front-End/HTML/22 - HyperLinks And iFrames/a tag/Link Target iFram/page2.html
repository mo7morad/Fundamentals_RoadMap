    <h2>Short Story #2</h2>
    <h1 style="color:green">The Wise Owl and the Rabbit</h1>
    
    <p>In a dense forest, there lived a wise old owl. The owl was known throughout the forest for its wisdom and knowledge. Animals from all over would come to seek advice from the owl. One day, a young rabbit approached the owl, worried about the upcoming winter. The owl advised the rabbit to gather food and build a warm shelter. The rabbit followed the owl's advice and worked hard to prepare for the winter. When the cold season arrived, the rabbit was safe and warm in its shelter, with plenty of food to last through the winter. The rabbit thanked the owl for its wise counsel, and the two became good friends.</p>

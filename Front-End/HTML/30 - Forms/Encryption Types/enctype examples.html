    Description: This is the default encoding type. Data is encoded in key-value pairs, and characters are URL-encoded (spaces are converted to "+" symbols, special characters to %XX where XX is the ASCII hex value).
    
    Use Case: Best used for forms that submit text fields. This content type is efficient for small forms and where files are not being submitted.

Use Case: Essential for forms that include file uploads, as it allows files to be sent to the server along with the text data. Also useful when submitting large data sets that include binary data.

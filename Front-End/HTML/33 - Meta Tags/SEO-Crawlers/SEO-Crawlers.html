    <meta name="robots" content="index, follow"> 
    <!-- 
    Purpose: This tag provides general instructions to all web crawlers about indexing and linking.
    
    index: Allows search engine bots to index the page, meaning the page can appear in search results.
    follow: Instructs bots to follow the links on the page, potentially indexing linked pages as well. -->

    <meta name="noarchive" content="noarchive"> 
    <!-- Purpose: Prevents search engines from storing a cached copy of the page.
    
    noarchive: Search engines like Google typically cache versions of web pages. This directive stops them from doing so, which might be necessary for content that is sensitive or changes frequently. -->


    <meta name="noindex" content="noindex"> 
    <!-- 
    Purpose: Stops search engines from including the page in their index.
    
    noindex: Useful for pages that should not appear in search results, such as internal pages, confidential information, or duplicate content. -->


    <meta name="nofollow" content="nofollow"> 
    <!-- 
    Purpose: Prevents search engines from following any links on the page.
    
    nofollow: Useful for pages where you do not want to pass link equity to the pages you link to, or when the links on the page are user-generated and potentially untrustworthy. -->



    <meta name="revisit-after" content="7 days"> 
    <!-- 
    Purpose: Advises search engines on how often they should revisit the page for potential re-indexing.
    
    revisit-after: This is more of an advisory tag and may not be strictly adhered to by crawlers, but it can be used to suggest a review frequency. -->


    <meta name="nosnippet" content="nosnippet"> 
    <!-- 
    Purpose: Prevents the display of snippets in search results.
    
    nosnippet: Can be used to control privacy or just to keep the search listings clean. This ensures that no text or video previews are shown in the search results. -->


    <meta name="noimageindex" content="noimageindex">
    <!-- 
    Purpose: Ensures that images on the page are not indexed.
    
    noimageindex: Important for pages where you may have copyrighted or sensitive images that you do not want appearing in image search results. -->


    <meta name="googlebot" content="index, follow, max-snippet:-1"> 
    <!-- 
    Purpose: Provides specific instructions only to Google's crawler.
    
    max-snippet:-1: This particular directive tells Google not to limit the size of the snippet. It could be used for giving Google specific indexing or snippet handling instructions differing from other bots. -->


    <meta name="bingbot" content="index, follow, noarchive"> <!-- Specific directives for Bing's crawler -->
    <!-- 
    Purpose: Specific directives tailored for Bing's crawler.
    Combines general indexing and following behavior with a noarchive directive specifically for Bing, potentially differing in handling from Google or other search engines. -->

    <!-- 
    Purpose of HTTP-Equiv Tags:
        These tags provide a way for HTML documents to send HTTP headers that would typically be set on the server. This capability is useful for pages served from environments where the developer might not have full control over server headers.
    Common Uses of HTTP-Equiv Tags:
        -Controlling caching behavior.
        -Redirecting users.
        -Specifying character sets.
        -Setting security policies.
        -others.

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <!--backward compatibility not for html 5, Specifies the MIME type and character encoding of the HTML document -->

     <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5"> 
    <!-- Refreshing the Current Page every 5 seconds -->

    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10; url=http://www.ProgrammingAdvices.com/">
    <!-- Redirects to a URL after a 10-second delay, used for redirect pages or notifications -->



    <meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache">
    <!-- Instructs browsers on how to cache page content, ideal for non-caching -->
    <!-- How It Works :
    Browser Behavior with no-cache: Upon encountering this meta tag, 
        the browser understands that it should not serve the page from cache without checking with the server first. 
        If the content on the server has changed since the last cache, the server will send the new content. 
        If not, the server may send a 304 (Not Modified) HTTP status, indicating that the cached version can be served.
    Use Case: This approach is particularly useful for dynamic content or during development stages 
              where changes are frequent, and ensuring the user sees the most recent version of a webpage is crucial. -->


    <meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache">
    <!-- Ensures compatibility with HTTP/1.0 caches, similar function to "Cache-Control" -->

    <meta http-equiv="expires" content="Wed, 21 Oct 2025 07:28:00 GMT">
    <!-- Sets an expiration date for the document -->
    <!-- Purpose and Function
        Expires: This directive serves as an instruction to web browsers and other caching systems about the 
        exact time after which the content should be considered stale. This is analogous to the Expires HTTP header.
        GMT Time Format: The value of the content attribute must be a date in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), also known as UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), in the specific format shown.

        How It Works:
        Effect on Caching: When a browser loads a webpage, it notes the expiry date set by this meta tag. If a user visits the same page before the expiry date, the browser might load the page from the cache rather than requesting it again from the server. Once the date has passed, the cached version of the page is considered expired, and the browser is expected to fetch a new copy of the page from the server the next time it is accessed.

        Use Case: This is particularly useful for managing content that changes periodically where it is beneficial to control when users should receive updated content without manually clearing caches. -->


    <meta http-equiv="Set-Cookie" content="name=value; expires=date; path=/;">
    <!-- Allows setting HTTP cookies from HTML documents -->

    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <!-- Forces Internet Explorer to use the latest rendering engine -->

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self';">
    <!-- Restricts resources to be loaded from the same origin, enhancing security -->
    <!-- A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard introduced to 
        help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection 
        attacks resulting from execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context.

    Impact on Security: By setting default-src 'self';, you are instructing the browser to ignore any resources that try to load from locations other than the origin of the current document. This significantly reduces the risk of successful attacks -->

# C++ Programming Fundamentals

This directory contains my solutions to the programming problems and exercises for level 01 of my the Backend fundamentals Roadmap.

The focus of this course was to build a strong foundation in **algorithmic thinking**, **problem-solving**, and the core syntax of **C++**. Instead of jumping straight into complex frameworks, I focused on breaking down problems into logical steps and translating them into efficient code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++
* **Concepts:** Variables, Data Types, Input/Output (`cin`/`cout`), Arithmetic Operators, Math Library (`cmath`), Conditional Logic, Loops.

## 📂 Project Structure & Topics Covered

The exercises in this course cover various fundamental concepts, categorized below:

### 1. 🧮 Basic Algorithms & Logic
* **Swap Numbers:** Swapping variables using a temporary variable.
* **Power Calculation:** Calculating exponents using loops and `pow()` functions.
* **Factorial/Sequence Printing:** (Derived from logic) Understanding number sequences.

### 2. 📐 Geometry & Math Formulas
Implemented various mathematical formulas to solve geometric problems:
* **Rectangle Area:** Calculating area given length and width.
* **Triangle Area:** Using base and height.
* **Circle Area:**
    * By Radius.
    * By Diameter.
    * By Circumference.
    * Inscribed in an Isosceles Triangle.
    * Described around an Arbitrary Triangle.

### 3. 💵 Financial & Utility Calculations
Applied programming logic to real-world scenarios:
* **Piggy Bank Calculator:** Calculating total cash from various coin denominations (Pennies, Nickels, Dimes, Quarters, Dollars).
* **Bill & Tax Calculator:** Computing service fees and sales tax logic.
* **Loan Installment Calculator:** Determining months to pay off a loan given a monthly payment.
* **Monthly Payment Calculator:** Determining the monthly installment given a specific timeframe.

### 4. ⏳ Time Management Logic
* **Seconds to Days/Hours/Minutes:** Converting a raw total of seconds into a readable time format (`D:H:M:S`).
* **Task Duration:** Calculating total duration in seconds from days, hours, and minutes.


## 📝 Key Takeaways
* Learned how to structure a program with the standard `main` function entry point.
* Understood the importance of variable types (`int`, `float`, `double`) and precision.
* Mastered the logic of swapping values, which is fundamental for sorting algorithms later.
* Gained confidence in translating mathematical problems into code.

	-- Create a local temporary table named #EmployeesTemp
	-- This table will be stored in the tempdb database and is visible only to this session
	CREATE TABLE #EmployeesTemp (
		EmployeeId INT,
		Name VARCHAR(100),
		Department VARCHAR(50)
	);

	-- Insert a records into the #EmployeesTemp table
	INSERT INTO #EmployeesTemp (EmployeeId, Name, Department)
	VALUES (10, 'Mohammed', 'Marketing');

	INSERT INTO #EmployeesTemp (EmployeeId, Name, Department)
	VALUES (11, 'Ali', 'Sales');

	-- Query the table
	SELECT * FROM #EmployeesTemp WHERE Department = 'Sales';

	-- Drop (delete) the temporary table #EmployeesTemp
	-- This is a good practice to clean up, although the table would automatically be deleted
	-- when the session ends
	DROP TABLE #EmployeesTemp;

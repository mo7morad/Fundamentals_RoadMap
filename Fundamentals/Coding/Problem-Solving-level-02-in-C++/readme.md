# Course 05: Algorithms, Problem Solving & Capstone Projects

This directory contains my solutions to the exercises and capstone projects for **Course 05** of the Backend Engineering Roadmap.

In this phase, the focus shifted from basic syntax to **Algorithmic Thinking** and **System Logic**. I solved over 50 algorithmic problems to master arrays and mathematical logic, and applied those concepts to build two fully functional console applications.

## 🏆 Capstone Projects

To wrap up the course, I built two interactive console applications that utilize loops, state management, and randomization.

### 1. 🧮 [Math Quiz Game](./Projects/MathQuiz)
A dynamic educational game that tests users with randomly generated math problems. It features dynamic difficulty levels (Easy to Mix), operation selection, and a full scoring system with visual feedback.

### 2. ✂️ [Stone-Paper-Scissors](./Projects/Scissors-Paper-Rock)
For Demo and Code please click on the project.
A complete implementation of the classic game against the computer. It features a robust game loop, round-by-round tracking, and smart "Game Over" logic.

## 📂 Algorithmic Problems (The Core Logic)

Before building the projects, I solved 50+ problems to master **Arrays** and recreate standard C++ library functions from scratch to understand how they work "under the hood."

### 1. 📊 Array Operations (The Core Focus)
Extensive practice with static arrays, covering almost every standard operation:
* **Basic Operations:** Calculating Sum, Average, Max, and Min of random arrays.
* **Search & Filter:** Linear Search algorithms and filtering logic (e.g., extracting only Odd/Prime numbers).
* **Advanced Manipulation:** Deep Copying, Reversing, Shuffling, and Vector Math.

### 2. 🔢 Advanced Math & Number Theory
Algorithms to analyze and manipulate integers at the bit/digit level:
* **Prime & Perfect Numbers:** Efficiently checking for Primes and generating lists.
* **Digit Manipulation:** Reversing integers mathematically (using Modulo `%`) without string conversion.

### 3. 🛠️ Recreating Standard Library Functions
Instead of blindly using `cmath` or `std`, I implemented my own versions:
* **`MyABS()`**: Logic for absolute values.
* **`MyCeil()` & `MyFloor()`**: Manual rounding logic.
* **`MySqrt()`**: Mathematical calculation of square roots.

### 4. 🔐 Security & Randomness
* **Key Generator:** A system to generate random license keys (e.g., `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`).
* **Encryption:** A simple Caesar Cipher implementation.
* **Brute Force:** An algorithm to generate all possible 3-letter passwords to match a target.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Structs & Enums:** Used heavily to organize Game/Quiz data.
    * **Modular Programming:** Breaking big games into small, reusable functions (`StartGame`, `PlayRound`).
    * **System Commands:** `system("cls")` and `system("color")` for UI experience.

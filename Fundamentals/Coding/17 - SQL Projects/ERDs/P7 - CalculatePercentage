select *, CAST(NumberOfVehicles as float) / CAST(TotalVehicles as float) as Perc from
(
	SELECT Makes.Make, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfVehicles, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM VehicleDetails) AS TotalVehicles
	FROM VehicleDetails JOIN Makes ON Makes.MakeID = VehicleDetails.MakeID
	WHERE Year BETWEEN 1950 AND 2000
	GROUP BY Makes.Make
) R1
ORDER BY NumberOfVehicles DESC;

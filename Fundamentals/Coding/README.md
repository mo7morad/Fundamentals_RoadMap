# Coding Section

This folder contains all the problem-solving tasks, console applications, and desktop projects that I developed as part of the Fundamentals Roadmap.

## Levels Overview

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Level 01 (C++)** | 20+ solved problems focusing on basic syntax and logic. |
| **Level 02 (C++)** | ~50 problems + simple console games (e.g., MathQuiz, Scissors-Paper-Rock). |
| **Level 03 (C++)** | ~50 problems + Banking System (2 versions). |
| **Level 04 (C++)** | ~65 problems + ATM simulation, Bank extension. |
| **Level 05 (C++)** | Data structures (linked list, queue, stack, dynamic array, etc.). |

## Other Projects

- **OOP-C++/** — Object-oriented projects (Banking, Client Management, Currency Exchange)  
- **14 - C# & WinForms/** — Desktop applications using C# (Tic-Tac-Toe, Pizza Shop)

## How to Run Code

1. Open the folder of the project or level you want to explore.  
2. Look at `.cpp` or `.cs` files.  
3. Compile/run using your preferred IDE or compiler:  
   - **C++:** `g++` / Visual Studio  
   - **C#:** Visual Studio / .NET

## Why These Projects?

These tasks and projects are designed to:
- Strengthen problem-solving skills  
- Practice core data structures  
- Build real-world console applications  
- Understand object-oriented design  
- Learn C# GUI development through WinForms

## What I Learned

- Syntax mastery in C++  
- OOP principles through real projects  
- Persistent data management (files, logs)  
- User input validation and state management  
- UI development with C# and Windows Forms

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the folder of the project or level you want to explore.  
2. Look at `.cpp` or `.cs` files.  
3. Compile/run using your preferred IDE or compiler:  
   - **C++:** `g++` / Visual Studio  
   1.  **Compile:**
    ```bash
    g++ FileName.cpp -o OutputName
    ```
   2.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    ./OutputName
    ```
   - **C#:** Microsoft Visual Studio / .NET console
